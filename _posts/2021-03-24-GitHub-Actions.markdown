Github Actions helps you create custom workflows during software development directly in your Github repository. These workflows are made out of different actions(tasks) that can be run automatically on certain events.

This enables you to include Continues Integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) capabilities and many other features directly in your repository.

## CI/CD
Continuous Integration(CI) and Continius Deployment(CD) are modern methods in the Software development cycle that reduce on the repitive tesing and deployment of software. GItHub actions is one of the simplest ways to implement CI and CD.

### Continuous Integration (CI)
Continuous integration (CI) is a software development practice that requires frequently committing code to a repository. Committing code usually detects errors faster and reduces the amount of code to debug when finding the source of an error. 

### Continuous Deployment (CD)
Continuous Deployment(CD) is a practice used to automatically publish a site that has its most recent changes submitted to Continuous integration tests. If the tests are passed, the changes are reflected in the published site.
